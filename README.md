Deepfakes Detection Challenge Using AI and Machine Learning

Facebook is funding research by delivering a deepfakes
detection challenge to the worldwide community of 2.37
Billion monthly active users. This AI challenges the community
to find solutions to fake or altered videos appearing on Facebook
and other publications. These fake videos have become known
as ”deepfakes” and are increasing in frequency on social media
websites as well as the Internet. This paper provides an overview
of deepfake identification methods with the aim of possibly securing
a grant for Pace University to fund research to better identify
deepfakes. Pace University’s team of strong data scientists has the
capability of improving the methods currently used to identify
deepfakes and ensuring that the worldwide community has a
safe and healthy video ecosystem. This is a critical role that
will be responsible for the measurement, detection and reduction
of negative user experiences ranging from violence and adult
content to evolving areas like misinformation and even fake
news. In order to achieve the goal of creating better deepfake
detection methods, we will look into the existing tools and attempt
to combine several of them. This will serve as a framework to
produce a more effective tool designed to differentiate both real
and fake videos and minimize the spread of fake news.
